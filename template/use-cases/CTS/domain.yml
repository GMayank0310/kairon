      There is no feasibility to change or update the Approved archetype directly in Mainspring.
      The project could be deleted and re-ported with a new project request with business justification approved by DE Enable POC for the respective Projects.
      This involves the data loss of existing risks, risk discovery, risk declaration, Delivery Governance, defects, metrics and the same cannot be restored at any point in time.
      In case of open OneBCM risks, request the PM to close the risk in mainspring and confirm on the closure update in onebcm before deleting the project as these risk will not flow again and all other instances can be imported before deletion.
  utter_risk_import_from_similar_projects_100:

  utter_risk_tracking_27:

      The Risk Assessment is renamed as Risk Discovery and it is accessible for the resources who has PM role for the project. To create a Risk Discovery, an existing open assessment should be completed.
      Once the Assessment is created, PM and the Risk Assessor will have access to edit the risk discovery.
      Assessment can be completed only if the responses for all the dimensions are filled.
      Note: If the project is an MSL then risk discovery will be availabe in the execution project

  utter_change_in_process_mapping_7:
  - text: |-
      If there is any change in the process mapping  corresponding to the given archetype and work category, the same would be notified in the mainspring release note and also respective DE Enable POC will be made aware.
      If your project has the same archetype and work category combination, please reopen the PM plan to view the change in process mapping, do necessary process selection and rebaseline the PM plan. The changed set of processes if selected after reopening PM plan, would reflect in all the open and new releases. 
      However a closed release would not reflect the changed list of processes.
  utter_metric_report_9:
  - text: |-
      Metrics report will be automatically generated on alternate Saturdays.
      Please be informed that the Metrics report will be generated in Mainspring only if the project has a Approved PM Plan and Open/Closed Release. 
      If any Release/Sprint is reopened and measures are updated, it will reflect immediately in the existing report (until the report is open)
      Note:
      The report will be auto-closed as “Not approved” if no action is taken by the Approver(ESAPM/PO/PPM) before the generation of the next report [14 days from report generation].
  utter_risk_capture_77:
  - text: Issue conceptually is a risk which has materialized and/or nothing can be done about it while it is not necessarily an escalation. In such scenarios, we advise them to be logged just as a Risk but mark Target Closure Date as the end-date of the project and Mitigation Status as ‘Not Required – Risk Accepted’.
  utter_risk_tracking_7:
  - text: |-
      Resources with PM role/Risk owner in mainspring will be able to close the risk. Update the mitigation and contigency status to Completed or Not required and then change the satus from Open to Close.

      Reason – some projects are under of the review-levels – SBU Head / BU Head / ERR / EC or already in BU Watchlist; hence those projects are not demoted to ‘BU Watchlist’. Therefore, for those projects which are already under review, we see just the system-recommendation.

      1. You must specify whether the applicable critical practices have been implemented in the release.
      2. You must provide your remarks for the following scenarios:
      a. An applicable critical practice is yet to be implemented in the release.
      b. A critical practice is not applicable for the release.

      If you mark the release as Completed, it is mandatory to confirm that the information provided for the implementation of critical practices is complete, accurate, and is in compliance with Cognizant policies.
